Tough-Guy WareHouse

How to Play:
Movement:		[8]				Up
			 [4]   [6]	->	Left  Right
			    [2]			   Down

Pick-up Items/
Go up/down stairs(if unlocked):   [5]

Manage Inventory: [9] Cycles between		Weapons -> Armors -> Consumables
				  [7] Cycles between		Equipped Weapons/Armor and currently usable consumable,
											depending on which one you have selected using [9].
											The Weapon/Armor that is displaying is the one that is equipped.
				  [0] Use/Sell				Sells Weapon/Armor or Uses Item, depending on selection via [9] and [7]

				  Hints:
					-The last bad guy on each floor will drop a key[^]. You have to select that item in your inventory
					and then press [0] to use it while standing on the stairs up [>] tile.
					-You can build up a chain which increases damage dealt by killing bad guys in succession 
					within a set number of turns. You get more turns to build a chain as you gain levels.
					-The log displays the 4 most recent events with the newest on top. New events are denoted with "->" 
					Item uses:
						The Sauce	 -gives 15 * player level health
						Energy drink -increase chain by 2 and resets number of turns before losing chain
						Stairwell Key-unlocks next floor
						Some Shells  -do nothing yet, still working on a shotgun that will let you use a projectile

					I'm still working on:
							-adding a shotgun which you will get on a non-randomly-generated floor midway through the game
							-adding a boss (which will require the shotgun) with his own boss-specific ai
							-adding a mid-floor shop to spend your $ on items
							-adding more story/attack panels. The story panels will display between levels.
